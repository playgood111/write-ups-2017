## Write-up

The Twitter user linked in the link only had one tweet: `OMＧ a ｍｉllｉoｎ ｐoiｎｔｓ ｃhallenge was found`. I saw that this text used Unicode homoglyphs (characters that look the same but have a different meaning). I googled "unicode homoglyph twitter secret" and the first link that came up was http://holloway.co.nz/steg/. This was a website where you could encode and decode some secret text into a tweet via Unicode homoglyphs. The flag (decoded from that website) was `bazinga`.
