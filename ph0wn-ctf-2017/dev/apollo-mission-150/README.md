## Description


-    Capsule. Commander, are we ready for takeoff?
-    HQ. Sure. All modules are functional. Yet, I can't find the button for ignition. Any possibility on your side?
-    Capsule. Negative commander. I guess you need to do the job. Find the link, and reprogram the takeoff procedure.
-    HQ. Ok, starting now. But how will I know it worked?
-    Capsule. We let you a present under the launch pad. Right after our take off, come to pick up your reward in a special envelop.

**Your duty:**
Have the drone take off, and then pick up a flag in the envelop located under the drone launch pad.

Rules:

-    Book the drone for 10 minutes
-    There is no flag in the drone itself
-    You are not allowed to reboot the drone or shut it down. If you have to do this, then ask us.
-    The drone is accessible on the following network: 172.16.5.0/24
