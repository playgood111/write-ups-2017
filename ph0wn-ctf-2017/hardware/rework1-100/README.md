# Ph0wn CTF: Rework 1

**Category**: Hardware, **Points**: 100, **Solves**: 9

## Description

Ouch, someone really messed up those PCBs and you need to fix it to
make it work and get the flags out ! Pick one level depending on how
confident you are with your soldering skills ! Each team will have
the option to pass once, after everyone passed (or declined) you will
be able to try a second challenge, and so on until there are no boards
left ! There is a limitted number of seats, so each team is given at
most 30 minutes to solve the challenge (but PCBs can be made available
in advance).

Write your team name on the page to register a slot/board and chose
the number of points you are looking for!
